# Cit√°ty

Simple quote-of-the-day app in Python and Qt. It's got slightly more brains than `random.choice(quotes)` and runs as a standalone app on Windows. That's it.

For quote-of-the-day in the browser, have a look at <https://github.com/tkarabela/citaty>.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- PySide
- cx_Freeze

## How to use it

1. Run `build.bat`.
2. The `dist` directory contains all you need to run the app.
3. To get your quote of the day, run `dist/citaty.exe`.
4. To add quotes, edit `dist/citaty.txt`, one line per quote, UTF-8 with BOM.
